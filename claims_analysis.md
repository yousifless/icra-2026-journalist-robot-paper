## **CONCLUSION**

The paper **strongly supports its technical performance and methodological claims** with solid experimental evidence. However, it **fails to adequately support its novelty, innovation, and problem-solving claims** due to lack of comparative analysis and real-world validation. The paper would benefit significantly from:

1. **Comprehensive literature review** supporting novelty claims
2. **Direct comparisons** with existing systems
3. **Real-world validation** of problem-solving capabilities
4. **More rigorous evaluation** of the proposed evaluation framework

The current evidence is **strong for what it measures** but **insufficient for the broader claims** made about the system's novelty and real-world impact.
